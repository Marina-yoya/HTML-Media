                <p class="text">Kukeri are elaborately costumed Bulgarian
                    men, who perform traditional rituals intended to scare away evil spirits. This Bulgarian tradition
                    has been practiced since Thracian times and is of a Thracian origin.
                    The costumes cover most of the body and include decorated wooden masks of animals
                    (sometimes double-faced) and large bells attached to the belt. Around New Year and before Lent, the
                    Kukeri walk and dance through villages to scare away evil spirits with their costumes and the sound
                    of their bells. They are also believed to provide a good harvest, health, and happiness to the
                    village for the year ahead.

                <p class="text">
                    The custom is generally thought to be related to the Thracian Dionysos cult in the wider area of
                    Thracia and similar rituals can also be found in much of the Balkans.
                    The term could be derived from Proto-Slavic kuka ("evil spirit") or from a pre-Slavic divinity named
                    Kuk.
                    The Kukeri traditionally visit people's houses at night so that "the sun would not catch them on the
                    road. After parading around the village, they usually gather at the village square
                    to dance wildly and amuse the people. Kukeri rituals vary by region, but remain largely the same in
                    essence.</p>

                    <p>Every year, hundreds of people in Bulgaria dress in elaborate monster costumes, often with large
                        bells attached, and parade through villages and into people’s homes to scare off evil and bring
                        good luck. These “monsters” are called kukeri, and boy, oh, boy, are they spectacular. The
                        costumes vary from region to region: Some are covered in long fur that streams in the wind as
                        the kukeri dance; others are elaborately embroidered and embellished with beads, glass, and bone
                        and topped off with an equally adorned mask. Many costumes have leather belts with dozens of
                        large bells attached to them.</p>

                <div class="text-wrapper" id="text2">
                    <p> The costumes are designed to scare away evil with their loud clanging and monstrous appearance.
                        Traditionally, these costumes are either inherited or carefully sewn and embellished by the
                        owner. Until recently, all kukeri were men, and, in many places, taking part in the kukeri dance
                        was seen as a rite of passage. Often, costumes are passed down from one generation to the next
                        and new costumes are made by the owner, possibly with help from local craftspeople. While
                        needlework in Bulgaria was considered women’s work, the kukeri were an exception: Men would work
                        on their costumes throughout the year.</p>

                    <p>Kukeri costumes are incredible pieces of folk art and are a unique glimpse back in time because
                        the tradition of the kukeri is quite old, so old, in fact, that we don’t know when it started.
                        Some estimates even suggest that the kukeri originated more than 4,000 years ago. While they’re
                        pagan in origin, the kukeri now appear around important Christian holidays. In some areas of
                        Bulgaria, you can find the kukeri between Christmas and the Epiphany (January 6), and in other
                        areas, the kukeri come the Sunday before Lent.</p>

                <div class="text-wrapper" id="text4">
                    <p>Today, the kukeri tradition is alive and strong in Bulgaria, although large parades are replacing
                        the individual home visits of the past. If you’re so inclined, the annual Surva Festival of
                        Masquerade Games is held in January and features kukeri from all around Bulgaria, so you can
                        book your tickets to Bulgaria now and glimpse these amazing outfits in person. Just know that
                        since the kukeri are associated with fertility, some of their dances and productions are—to put
                        it mildly—on the bawdy side.</p>
