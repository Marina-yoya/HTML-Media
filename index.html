                <p class="text">Kukeri are elaborately costumed Bulgarian
                    men, who perform traditional rituals intended to scare away evil spirits. This Bulgarian tradition
                    has been practiced since Thracian times and is of a Thracian origin.
                    The costumes cover most of the body and include decorated wooden masks of animals
                    (sometimes double-faced) and large bells attached to the belt. Around New Year and before Lent, the
                    Kukeri walk and dance through villages to scare away evil spirits with their costumes and the sound
                    of their bells. They are also believed to provide a good harvest, health, and happiness to the
                    village for the year ahead.

                <p class="text">
                    The custom is generally thought to be related to the Thracian Dionysos cult in the wider area of
                    Thracia and similar rituals can also be found in much of the Balkans.
                    The term could be derived from Proto-Slavic kuka ("evil spirit") or from a pre-Slavic divinity named
                    Kuk.
                    The Kukeri traditionally visit people's houses at night so that "the sun would not catch them on the
                    road. After parading around the village, they usually gather at the village square
                    to dance wildly and amuse the people. Kukeri rituals vary by region, but remain largely the same in
                    essence.</p>
